# NetworkThroughputMeasureTool

Measure the throughput of client devices at different distances from an Access Point (AP). The program contains source code for a Client who sends a constant stream of bytes to a Server which reads in the Streamed bytes into a data buffer and graphs the Average Through vs Time.

Please run Receiver (SERVER) first to configure cached settings.

`$ python Receiver.py`

Then run Sender to monitor Network Traffic

`$ python Sender.py`
